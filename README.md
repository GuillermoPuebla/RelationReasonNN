# RelationReasonNN
Repository for the paper "The relational processing limits of classic and contemporary neural network models of language processing"
The main script "test_models.py" has all the functions to test the models in all conditions.
The "stories.py" script defines a "story" class and the individual story classes where all the methods necesarry to generate individual stories are implemented.
All the models are implemented in Keras and the Story Gestal model uses the Recurrentshop ramework (https://github.com/farizrahman4u/recurrentshop)
All the weights used for the sims in the paper are available as .hdf5 files
